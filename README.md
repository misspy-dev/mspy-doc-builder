# [mspy-doc-builder](https://pypi.org/project/mspy-doc-builder/)
A simple command line tool to build Sphinx and integrate it with the build and Japanese versions of the English documents.

It is used for building misspy documentation on cloudflare pages, etc.

# Dependency
Almost everything is implemented with built-in libraries.

In order to be able to run it as a command line tool, we use [python-poetry/cleo](https://github.com/python-poetry/cleo).

# How To Use
```bash
$ mspy build
```
